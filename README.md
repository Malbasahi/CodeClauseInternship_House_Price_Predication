# CodeClauseInternship House Price Prediction
house price prediction project involves building a regression model to predict the prices of residential houses based on various features. The project covers several key aspects, including data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and prediction of new data.

# Project Description 
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project begins by loading a dataset containing information about residential houses, including features such as the type of dwelling, lot area, quality, and condition of the house, year built, and many others. Data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling. This includes handling missing values, feature selection, and feature scaling.

Feature Selection: Relevant features for the prediction task are selected from the dataset. The most essential features are chosen based on their correlation with the target variable, "SalePrice."

Model Selection: Several regression models are considered for the prediction task, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others. These models are trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the selected model (Gradient Boosting) are optimized using Grid Search with cross-validation to potentially improve prediction accuracy.

Cross-Validation: The project ensures that the model's performance is stable across different subsets of the data using cross-validation. This step helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Prediction for New Data: The final trained model, after optimization, is used to make predictions for new data. The model is applied to a set of new house features to predict their prices.

Evaluation: The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using evaluation metrics, including MSE and R2 score, to assess how well the model performs on both the training data and the new data.

Result Analysis: The project concludes with an analysis of the model's performance, including the accuracy of predictions for both the training data and new data.
